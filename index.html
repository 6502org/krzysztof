<title>Krzysztof Swiecicki's Pages</title>
My name is Krzysztof Swiecicki and I live in Poland.  I really like the
6502 microprocessor and I have built some controllers and computers based
on it.  Here are four photos of my projects:

<ul>
<li><a href="kom2.jpg">kom2.jpg</a> - A serial communications board based
on the 16C450 UART.</li>
<li><a href="sound2.jpg">sound2.jpg</a> - A full 16-bit sound port based
on the Analong Devices AD1848.</li>
<li><a href="ster2.jpg">ster2.jpg</a> - A simple computer based on the
6502 from an Atarti XL/XE, overclocked to run at 4.5MHz.  32KB of Static
RAM (62256), Flash ROM (29EE010), 8502 CIA (from an Amiga 500), and an
82C54 timer/counter.</li>
<li><a href="ster21.jpg">ster21.jpg</a> - A computer based on the 65SC816,
used as an automotive fuel injection controller.  It has two CIAs, 32KB
RAM, 8KB EEPROM, ADC0809 Analog to Digital Converter, and an 82C54 for PWM
or pulse generation.
